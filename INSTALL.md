# üì¶ PhantomFox - Firefox `user.js` Installation Guide (All Platforms)

This guide explains how to install the **PhantomFox** `user.js` configuration (Betterfox-based with enhanced privacy and Discord WebRTC compatibility) on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.

## üß† What is `user.js`?

Firefox checks for a file named `user.js` in your profile directory when it starts. If it exists, Firefox applies all the preferences defined in it. This allows full control over Firefox behavior, especially for privacy and performance enhancements.
