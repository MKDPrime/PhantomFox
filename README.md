# PhantomFox user.js

A minimalist but powerful **`user.js` configuration** for Firefox.  
Designed as a lightweight alternative to **Arkenfox** and **Betterfox**, focused on **privacy, security, and performance** without breaking usability.  

PhantomFox disables telemetry, Firefox Sync, tracking features, and adds several performance optimizations ‚Äî while keeping important protections (like Safe Browsing) enabled.  

---

## ‚ú® Features
- Works on **Linux, macOS, and Windows**  
- **Privacy-first**: disables telemetry, Sync, WebRTC leaks, geolocation, battery API, and more  
- **Performance tweaks**: hardware acceleration, optimized connections, WebRender  
- **Minimal startup**: Firefox opens with `about:blank` for speed and focus  
- **Security**: Safe Browsing (malware & phishing protection) stays enabled  
- Easy to **update with a single terminal command**

## ‚ù§Ô∏è PhantomFox supports all Firefox-based browsers
Yes, you heard right, PhantomFox user.js works on all Firefox-based browsers! It works correctly on all Firefox-based browsers such as Zen, LibreWolf, and WaterFox. My goal here is to achieve a much more user-friendly experience. You can also apply the following download steps to your own Firefox-based browser.
