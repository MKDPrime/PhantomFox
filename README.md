# 🎯 Custom `user.js` for Firefox – Balanced Privacy & Performance

This repository contains a customized `user.js` file based on [Betterfox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox), with additional privacy-focused tweaks inspired by [arkenfox](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js). It's designed specifically for users who value **privacy** but also need full compatibility with modern websites like **YouTube**.

## 🛠️ Installation (Briefly)

1. Go to the `about:profiles` page in Firefox
2. Open the active profile folder
3. Place the `user.js` file in this folder

## 🔒 Recommended Extensions

To get even better results, I recommend using the following Firefox add-ons:

- [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)
- [ClearURLs](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/clearurls/)
- [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/)

## 🙋 Who is this for?

This config is ideal for:
- YouTubers, content creators, and regular users who use sites like YouTube regularly
- People who care about their online privacy but don’t want to break the web
- Anyone who wants a set-it-and-forget-it Firefox configuration
