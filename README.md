# 🎯 Custom `user.js` for Firefox – Balanced Privacy & Performance

This repository contains a customized `user.js` file based on [Betterfox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox), with additional privacy-focused tweaks inspired by [arkenfox](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js). It's designed specifically for users who value **privacy** but also need full compatibility with modern websites like **YouTube**.

---

## ✅ Features

- 🛡️ Strong privacy protections (fingerprinting, cookies, WebRTC)
- ⚙️ Betterfox performance optimizations
- 📺 100% working with YouTube, Google, and major sites
- 💨 Fast browsing without sacrificing too much privacy
- 📱 Mobile and desktop-friendly setup

---

## 📂 Included File

- `user.js` – The configuration file you need to copy into your Firefox profile directory.

---

## 📥 How to Use

1. Go to `about:profiles` in Firefox.
2. Find your active profile and click **“Open Folder”**.
3. Place the downloaded `user.js` file into that folder.
4. Close Firefox completely (including from the background).
5. Reopen Firefox – your custom privacy settings will now be active.

## 🔒 Recommended Extensions

To get even better results, I recommend using the following Firefox add-ons:

- [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)
- [ClearURLs](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/clearurls/)
- [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/)

## 🙋 Who is this for?

This config is ideal for:
- YouTubers, content creators, and regular users who use sites like YouTube regularly
- People who care about their online privacy but don’t want to break the web
- Anyone who wants a set-it-and-forget-it Firefox configuration
